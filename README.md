Udacity Machine Learning Capstone - A Machine Learning Based Human Activity Recognizer

In this README file, I will include a link and instructions on how to the run the project once the data is downloaded. 

Installations
This project was written in the Anaconda environment and Python 3.7
Motivation
The purpose of this project was to analyse data generated from smartphone sensors and to build a model that could accurately classify 6 different activity types: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.
